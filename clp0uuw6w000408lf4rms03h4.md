**Securathon Hackathon: Building a Secure Chat Application with Pangea**

I'm excited to share my experience participating in the Securathon hackathon on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) in partnership with Pangea. For this hackathon, I built a secure chat application using Express.js, React, and Pangea's Vault, URL Intel, and Domain Intel services.

**Pangea: A Powerful Platform for Security**

[Pangea](http://console.pangea.cloud) is a comprehensive security platform that provides a wide range of services to help organizations protect their data and applications. Some of Pangea's most popular services include:

* **Vault:** A secure key management service that helps organizations encrypt and decrypt their data at rest and in transit.
    
* **URL Intel:** A service that provides real-time intelligence on URLs, including their safety and reputation.
    
* **Domain Intel:** A service that provides real-time intelligence on domains, including their ownership, registration history, and associated malware.
    

**My Project: A Secure Chat Application**

My project for the Securathon hackathon was a secure chat application that uses Pangea's Vault, URL Intel, and Domain Intel services to protect user data and privacy. Here are some of the key features of my application:

* **End-to-end encryption:** All messages are encrypted using Pangea's Vault service before they are sent to the server.
    
* **URL filtering:** URLs are filtered using Pangea's URL Intel service to prevent users from visiting malicious websites.
    
* **Domain monitoring:** Domains are monitored using Pangea's Domain Intel service to identify and block phishing attacks.
    

I'm very proud of what I was able to accomplish in the Securathon hackathon. My secure chat application is a valuable tool that can help organizations protect their data and privacy.

**Pangea Services Used**

In my project, I used the following Pangea services:

* **Vault:** I used Vault to encrypt and decrypt user messages.
    
* **URL Intel:** I used URL Intel to filter URLs and prevent users from visiting malicious websites.
    
* **Domain Intel:** I used Domain Intel to monitor domains and identify and block phishing attacks.
    

I found Pangea's services to be easy to use and integrate into my application. The services provided the security and protection I needed to build a secure chat application.

I encourage you to check out Pangea ([console.pangea.cloud](http://console.pangea.cloud)) and see how its services can help you protect your data and applications.
