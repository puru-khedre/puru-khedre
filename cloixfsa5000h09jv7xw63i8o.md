## Introduction

### What is Airbyte & Low-code CDK

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/), an open-source data integration platform, has revolutionized the way we connect and synchronize data from diverse sources. Low-code CDK is a new Airbyte connector development framework that makes it even easier to develop and maintain Airbyte connectors.

My journey with Lowcode CDK began during the Hashnode x Airbyte Hackathon, where I had the opportunity to work on migrating Airbyte connectors from Python CDK to Low-code CDK. It was an invaluable experience that allowed me to both explore the potential of Low-code CDK and contribute to the vibrant Airbyte community.

In this article, I'll dive into how Lowcode CDK is shaping the future of Airbyte connector development, simplifying the process for all to craft robust data integration pipelines.
